# Basic raspberry pi setup files

Flash sd card using etcher with latest raspbian image. Copy the ssh and wpa_supplicant.conf file into the boot directory of the sd card. Update the wpa_supplicant.conf file with the correct ssid and password for the network. 

Quick note: the pi zero does not have 5Ghz networking, so don't use a 5Ghz network...
